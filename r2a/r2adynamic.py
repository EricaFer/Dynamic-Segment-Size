@description: Dynamic Segment-Size Implementation on pyDash

Here lies the implementation of "Dynamic Segment Size Selection in HTTP Based Adaptative Video Streaming",
paper written by Luca Bedogni, Marco Di Felice and Luciano Bononi, about a new selection of segment sizes in a video streaming method.
The project consists on analysing the bandwidth oscilations, as well as the previous selections made in the segment size of the video, and then, use
estimations to calculate what is the best next segment to choose, based on the network average capacity.

This work was mostly done by Erica Fernandes, but the other group members put effort on writing the report of the implemetation, as well as showing the comparisons
with other approaches.
